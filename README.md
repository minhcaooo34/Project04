1. The map was represented as a 2D grid of tiles, where each tile is treated as a vertex in the graph. The relationship between tiles is established based on the adjacency matrix. The graph is implicitly represented using the 2D grid (vector<vector<char>>).

2. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue (min-heap) and processes vertices based on their current minimum distance. The cost is O(logV) per operation, where ùëâ is the number of vertices (tiles). Overall, the time complexity of Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm in this context is O((V+E)logV).

Execution Time: The algorithm scales reasonably well for practical map sizes, although the growth in time for very large maps is noticeable.
Memory Usage: As the number of tiles grows, memory usage becomes more of a concern, particularly for extremely large maps. This is a direct consequence of needing to store distances, previous nodes, and the priority queue.
